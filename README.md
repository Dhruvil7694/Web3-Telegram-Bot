Certainly! If you want to use Ngrok to expose your local development server to the internet and then use that URL with Moralis, here are the step-by-step instructions:

**Step 1: Download and Install Ngrok**

1. Visit the Ngrok website: [https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/)
2. Sign up for a free Ngrok account.
3. Download the Ngrok executable for your operating system.
4. Extract the downloaded archive if needed.

**Step 2: Authenticate Ngrok (Optional but Recommended)**

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where Ngrok is located.
3. Authenticate Ngrok with your account by running the following command:

    ```bash
    ./ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
    ```

   Replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` with the token you obtained from the Ngrok website.

**Step 3: Start Ngrok for Your Local Server**

1. Run your local development server. Suppose it's running on port 3000; adjust the port accordingly.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where Ngrok is located.

4. Start Ngrok to expose your local server:

    ```bash
    ./ngrok http 3000
    ```

   Adjust `3000` to the port number where your local server is running.

**Step 4: Copy Ngrok Forwarding URL**

1. After running Ngrok, you'll see a public URL listed as "Forwarding" in the terminal.

    ```
    Forwarding                    https://randomstring.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000
    ```

   Copy the `https://randomstring.ngrok.io` part.

**Step 5: Configure Moralis with Ngrok URL**

1. Go to the [Moralis Dashboard](https://admin.moralis.io/).

2. Open your Moralis app.

3. In the app settings, look for a section related to server URLs or network configurations.

4. Find a field where you can input a server URL or webhook URL.

5. Paste the Ngrok URL you copied in Step 4.

6. Save the changes.

**Step 6: Test the Connection**

1. Make sure your local development server is still running.

2. Perform actions in your application that would trigger Moralis events (e.g., create/update/delete objects).

3. Check the Ngrok terminal for any incoming requests.

   Ngrok will display details about each request, and you should see requests coming from Moralis.

Please note that Ngrok URLs are temporary and may change every time you restart Ngrok. Consider using a tool like [ngrok-notify](https://github.com/dstotijn/ngrok-notify) to receive notifications when your Ngrok URL changes.
